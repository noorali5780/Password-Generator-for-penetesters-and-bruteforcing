# Password Generation Script

## Overview

This Python script, developed by **SADIKI NA**, is designed to generate a large number of unique password variations based on user-provided base words. The script introduces variations by appending special characters, numbers, and mixing cases, creating a wide array of potential passwords. It's an efficient tool that can help penetration testers quickly generate numerous password variations for testing and securing systems.

## Features

- **Base Word Variations**: Generates password variations from single or combined base words.
- **Special Characters and Numbers**: Adds special characters and numbers to increase password complexity.
- **Mixed Case Letters**: Introduces mixed case letters for additional variation.
- **Customizable Output**: Generates up to 100,000 unique passwords, with the ability to save them to a file specified by the user.

## How It Helps Penetration Testers

For penetration testers, password variation is a critical aspect of testing the robustness of a system's security. This script allows penetration testers to:

- **Quickly Generate Password Variations**: Generate thousands of unique passwords in seconds, helping to test password strength and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Create Complex Passwords**: The script introduces a wide range of variations, from simple tweaks to more complex combinations, covering a broad spectrum of possible passwords.
- **Customize for Specific Needs**: Use specific base words relevant to the target environment, increasing the likelihood of finding weak or common passwords.

## Ethical Usage

**Important**: This script should be used **ethically** and with the proper permissions. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the script is only used for legal and authorized security testing purposes. Any misuse of this script for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited and against the principles of ethical hacking.

## How to Use

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   
2. **Clone the Repository or Download the Script**: Download the script to your local machine.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Execute the script using `python <script_name>.py`.
   - Example: `python password_generator.py`.

4. **Input Base Words**: When prompted, enter the base words separated by spaces. These words will be used as the foundation for generating password variations.

5. **Specify Output File**: Enter the file path where you want the generated passwords to be saved.

6. **Review Output**: The script will generate the specified number of passwords and save them to the file you provided.

## Example

```bash
Enter base words separated by spaces (e.g., 'password admin june '): 
admin root test

Enter the full file path where you want to save the passwords (e.g., 'C:\\Users\\Jinx\\Documents\\password.txt'):
C:\\Users\\Jinx\\Documents\\passwords.txt

Generating passwords...
Generated 100000 unique passwords.
Passwords successfully saved to 'C:\\Users\\Jinx\\Documents\\passwords.txt'.
```
